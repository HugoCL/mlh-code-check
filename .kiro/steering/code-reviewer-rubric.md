# Fellowship Code Reviewer Rubric

This rubric is implemented as a system template in the application. Use the "Fellowship Code Reviewer" template when creating analyses.

## Evaluation Criteria

The template evaluates GitHub repositories against these criteria:

### Code Quality (Yes/No with justification)
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive, unambiguous, pronounceable, searchable names
- **Function Quality**: Small functions, single responsibility, descriptive names, no side effects
- **Comment Quality**: Self-explanatory code, comments explain intent, not noisy
- **Code Structure**: DRY, separated concepts, variables near usage, proper formatting
- **Library Usage**: Effective use of libraries/APIs interacting together
- **Object Orientation**: Appropriate use of OO principles when applicable

### Project Assessment (Scale 1-3)
- **Structure & Navigation**: 1=Hard to navigate, 2=Workable but messy, 3=Clear with documentation
- **Originality**: 1=Template with no changes, 2=Template with additions, 3=Unique project
- **Boilerplate**: 1=Mostly autogenerated, 2=Mix of boilerplate and custom, 3=Mostly unique
- **Documentation**: 1=Missing/empty, 2=Basic description, 3=Full explanation with setup
- **Testing**: 1=No tests, 2=Basic tests, 3=Comprehensive coverage

### Final Determination (Yes/No)
- **Yes** = Skip candidate (only when certain there's no Fellowship-level skill)
- **No** = Needs further assessment

## Usage

1. Select "Fellowship Code Reviewer" template when creating a new analysis
